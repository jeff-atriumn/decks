            # Best Practices for User Stories
            ---
            ## Slide 1: Introduction

            - test environments mitigate risk
            - but test environments _can_ enforce/require slow & inefficient processes
            - Let's throw out everything - start from scratch
            ---
            ## Slide 2: My Early Struggles - standards and why

            - we should have a test environment that looks like prod
            ---
            ## - Veritical Slices
            ---
            ## - Acceptance Criteria is Everything (Literally)
            - grocery store checklist
              - don't need directions, speed limit
              - just need value
            - committable
            - testable
            ---
            ## - Acceptance Criteria is Test Cases
            - test cases => validation
            ---
            ## - Acceptance Criteria is a Contract
            - PM <=> ENG <=> QA <=> Stakeholder
            ---
            ## - Acceptance Criteria is Human Readable
            ---
            ## - Acceptance Criteria is Tight
            - lots of test cases?
            - new stories
            - see SPIDR
            - extra shit is wasteful
            ---
            ## - How? SPIDR

            - spike
            - path
            - interface
            - data
            - rules
            ---
                 ## Slide 10: Key Takeaways & Conclusion

            - Summarize the best practices discussed in the presentation
            - Encourage the audience to reflect on their own test environment processes
            - Invite questions and discussion
