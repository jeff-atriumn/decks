            # Best Practices for Test Environments
            ---
            ## Slide 1: Introduction
            
            - test environments mitigate risk
            - but test environments _can_ enforce/require slow & inefficient processes 
            - Let's throw out everything - start from scratch
            ---
            ## Slide 2: My Early Struggles - standards and why
            
            - we should have a test environment that looks like prod
            - let's call it staging - it will gate everything
            - staging catches some things, not all - but useful (data concerns, regulatory concerns, 3rd party concerns, costs, infra)
            - product grows - teams grow --- collisions
            - coordinations - my stuff needs to go there now, can you wait? i created data that i need!
            - code can be mitigated a bit by cleaner branching strategies, but data, expectations, varying release schedules can be problematic
            ---
            ## - How about another environment? QA!

            - let's use staging as a (pre)prod-copy only. this is a sensitive place
            - avoids collisions in the sensitive space
            - let's create a QA environment
            - perhaps more liberal with data
            - more liberal with code branches
            - teams are still growing - more collisions, more data hiccups, more general confusion (feature flags), more investment and capacity required from platform & infra teams
            ---
            ## - How about another environment? Dev!

            - let's use QA as a (pre)(pre)prod-copy only. let's make QA  more official - this is a sensitive place
            - avoids collisions in the sensitive space
            - let's create a place where the QA rules don't apply - lets call it DEV
            - perhaps more liberal with data, code, integrations, trust, etc
            - teams are still growing - more collisions, more data hiccups, more general confusion (feature flags)
            ---
            ## - How about another environment? Dev2(?)

            - rinse repeat
            ---
            ## Slide 6: Best Practices - Configuration Management
            
            - Use version control systems to manage code and configurations
            - Ensure consistency across all environments
            - Automate deployment processes
            ---
            ## Slide 7: Best Practices - Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
            
            - Emphasize the importance of CI/CD in a test environment
            - Discuss the benefits of implementing CI/CD
            - Share tools and technologies that can facilitate CI/CD
            ---
            ## Slide 8: Best Practices - Monitoring & Reporting
            
            - Monitor test environments for issues and performance
            - Implement logging and reporting systems to track progress and identify issues
            - Set up automated alerts for critical incidents
            ---
            ## Slide 9: Case Study - My Personal Success Story
            
            - Share a personal story of how implementing best practices transformed your test environment
            - Discuss the improvements you saw in terms of efficiency, reduced bugs, and faster deployment
            ---
            ## Slide 10: Key Takeaways & Conclusion
            
            - Summarize the best practices discussed in the presentation
            - Encourage the audience to reflect on their own test environment processes
            - Invite questions and discussion
